# IntelliJ IDEA Project Files
# Generally, it's good to ignore the whole .idea directory,
# but some teams choose to share specific configuration files.
# If you want to ignore everything in .idea except for specific files
# you'd list them with !.idea/filename.xml
# However, a common and simpler approach is to ignore the whole directory:
.idea/

# If you prefer to explicitly list what NOT to ignore from .idea (less common for solo devs or many teams):
# .idea/gradle.xml
# .idea/misc.xml
# .idea/vcs.xml
# .idea/modules.xml
# .idea/compiler.xml
# .idea/jarRepositories.xml
# .idea/render.experimental.xml # If you use experimental rendering features
# *.ipr # Older IntelliJ project format
